# Configuration

Project configuration is loaded using py-ms library based on yml or json file. You must set the project name `APP_NAME` and the path prefix of the project `APPLICATION_ROOT`.
Some example files are config.yml, config-docker.yml and tests/config-tests.yml.

It's also important to check `setup.py`.
